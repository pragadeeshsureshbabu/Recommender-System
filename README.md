# Recommender-System
DonorsChoose.org is a United Statesâ€“based 501(c) nonprofit organization that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom projects. In January 2018, they announced that 1 million projects had been funded. In 77% of public schools in the United States, at least one project has been requested on DonorsChoose.org.Schools from wealthy areas are more likely to make technology requests, while schools from less affluent areas are more likely to request basic supplies. It's been noted that repeat donors on DonorsChoose typically donate to projects they have no prior relationship with, and most often fund projects serving financially challenged students.

A Recommender System predicts the likelihood that a user would prefer an item. As far as my project is concern,the requirement of the Recommendation System is to recommend a user a project to donate to.
